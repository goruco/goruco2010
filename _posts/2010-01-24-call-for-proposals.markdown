The Gotham Ruby Conference, a one-day, single-track event in New York City, is now accepting
proposal papers. GoRuCo will be held on May 22nd, 2010 on the Manhattan campus of Pace University,
our hosts for the day.

GoRuCo is a technical conference aimed at highly motivated programmers interested in all things Ruby.
You'll spend the day among leading Rubyists, innovators and developers in New York City, home of
Silicon Alley. Past topics have ranged from pragmatic new approaches to design and testing, to
pioneering language application and far-reaching abstractions.

We are looking for individual speakers and moderated panel discussions. We will have around seven
slots, depending on the quantity and quality of the proposals we receive.

### Individual speakers

The majority of the day's content will be individual talks. Our speakers will receive:

* Free attendance to the event.
* A $300 honorarium.
* A $600 travel reimbursement if you live outside of the tri-state region.

Talks should be at most 40 minutes long, including time for questions and discussion. A good
proposal paper for your talk will include:

* An explanation or outline of your talk.
* A short biographical statement about you and your involvement in the Ruby community.
* Your city and state of residence.

All proposals must specify exactly who will be presenting. For example, we will not accept proposals
from companies unless they specify who will be presenting on behalf of the company. Presentations
may be given by more than one person, but multiple speakers will split the honorarium and travel
reimbursement.

### Panel discussions

We are also accepting proposals for panel discussions composed of a moderator and up to four
panelists. Panel moderators and panelists will receive free admission, but no honorarium and no
travel reimbursement.

Panel discussions should be at most 40 minutes long, including time for questions from the audience.
A good proposal paper for your panel discussion will include:

* An explanation or outline of the topic under discussion.
* A full list of up to four panelists.
* Short biographical statements of the moderator and panelists.
* The state of residence of the moderator and panelists.

If you are submitting a proposal for a panel discussion, we ask that you get a firm commitment from
your panelists to appear at GoRuCo if your panel is accepted. We understand that last-minute changes
are likely when coordinating a group; however, we reserve the right to remove a panel from our
schedule if the panel changes drastically from what was originally proposed. Please make it easy on
everybody by only proposing a panel if you are fairly certain that most of your panelists can make
it.

### Local speakers and panel moderators

GoRuCo believes in highlighting local talent. We reserve at least two slots for local speakers or
panels. Individual talks and panels will be considered local if at least half of the participants
are from the tri-state region - that is, within typical commuting distance of Manhattan. In the
past, these slots have been less competitive than the other talk slots, so if you live in the
tri-state region we strongly urge you to submit a proposal.

### Video

We will be videotaping all the talks and panels, and making this video freely available online. You
should be okay with this if you are submitting a talk or a panel, and if you are submitting a panel,
all of your panelists should be okay with this.

### How to submit

Please send all proposals to [proposals@goruco.com](mailto://proposals@goruco.com) by 11:59 PM EST
on March 26, 2010. You should receive confirmation that we have received your proposal within 48
hours of submitting it.
