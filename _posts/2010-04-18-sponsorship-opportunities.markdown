GoRuCo, a one-day, single-track event in New York City dedicated to everything Ruby, is now 
accepting sponsors inquires. This conference will be held on Saturday, **May 22nd** in the Manhattan 
campus of Pace University, our hosts for the day.

GoRuCo is headed by leaders in the region's Ruby and Rails community, including founders of the 
New York City Ruby user group, and past speakers at the International Ruby Conference and RailsConf. 
GoRuCo's sold-out 2007, 2008 and 2009 conferences have been highly acclaimed by both local and 
visiting Rubyists and this year looks to be just as good.
