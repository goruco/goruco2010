Pivotal Labs has a significant reputation in Silicon Valley for
product development, reliable execution, and process innovation. We
work with some of the most innovative tech companies around, like
Salesforce.com and a couple of multi-billion dollar tech companies you
have probably heard of.

We bring agile methods to both new and existing teams, helping them
produce business value faster, with less waste, higher quality, and
lower cost. We get in the trenches with our clients, build real
products in their environment, and leave them with sustainable
practices when we're done.

We now have a large team in New York, ready to help make your project

developers first and then as coaches. Cyrus developer-coaches have a deep
understanding of Agile principles and practices and the ability to transfer
that knowledge.
